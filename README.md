A repository for the marine community to raise any issues they may have with the MEDIN portal at https://portal.medin.org.uk/portal/start.php.

Documentation related to the MEDIN portal will also be stored here for access by the community. If you would like to contact the MEDIN core team for any reason there is always enquiries@medin.org.uk which we will react to within 24 hours.
